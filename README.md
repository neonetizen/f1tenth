# 🏎️ F1TENTH Autonomous Racing Project

Welcome to **Big Fish Co.**'s F1Tenth project repository.
This repo contains our work on building, configuring, and experimenting with a **1/10th scale autonomous race car**. This platform is designed for learning and researching **robotics, computer vision, and autonomous systems**

--- 

## 🏁 What is F1Tenth?
F1Tenth, or RoboRacer, is an international, semi-annual autonomous racing competition where teams design and build 1/1th scale, self-driving vehicles that race each other in real-time. The cars are equipped with sensors, embedded computers, and software stacks, such as **ROS 2**, to explore algorithms for:
- Perception (LiDAR, camera-based)
- Localization & Mapping (SLAM)
- Planning & Control (Racing algorithm strategies)
- Systems Integration (ROS 2, embedded systems, real-time control)

More information about the initiative can be found at [f1tenth.org](https://f1tenth.org)
