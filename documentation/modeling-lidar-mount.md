## What it is

The LiDAR mount is designed to give the LiDAR sensor on the car a better position to take in data and be able to see more by elevating its position while also enabling for ease of maintenance and management. 
## Purpose

Designing the LiDAR mount is meant to give the sensor a better position to better map out the surroundings of the car. It also allows for greater customization and allows for further redesigning of the original vehicle to allow for teams to try to find an advantage on the car.

## Design

The simple design of the mount is both easy to produce and functional, as it allows for the LiDAR to sit higher in the front of the car, giving it a better spot to take in data and "see" more. Along with this, the open design allows for easy maintenance and cable management for the sensor and the rest of the vehicle. 
## Specifications and Materials

The specifications of the mount follow the design of the mounting plate on the car, provided below.

The plastic used to produce this is PETG (Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol), which is a more durable and offers more strength compared to regular PLA. This is important since testing for the car it is possible it will crash at high speeds, therefore requiring better and stronger material.
